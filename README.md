## Description
An easy to use notes app that allows for creating persistent notes and deleting them when no longer needed. This is a **WORK IN PROGRESS**.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Installation
Clone this repo, open **Develop** directory in your CLI, and perform an ```npm install```. I am deploying this app on **Heroku**, but use whatever hosting method you prefer or test it locally with a utility like [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/). More information to come as I further develop this application.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Usage
Once installed and hosted, navigate to the ```index.html``` in a browser and begin creating notes. Again, more details and a demo YouTube video to come soon.
